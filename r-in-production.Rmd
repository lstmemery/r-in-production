knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## A Disclaimer

 - This is not an invitation to start a language war
 - R can do things that Python can't
 - You will encounter data scientists that only know R and that's fine

## Who Am I?

 - A senior data scientist at Imbellus Inc.
 - I do a lot data engineering work

## Difficulties in Deployment

1. Testability
2. Reliability
3. Interopterability

## Testability

 - Most R starts it's life as a one-off script
 - This code is rarely tested
 - What's an easy way to test?

```{r}
horse_kicks <- readr::read_csv("data/VonBort.csv")
glm(family="poisson")
```

## Turn Your Code Into a Package

![R Packages by Hadley Wickham](./img/r-packages.png)
 - Functions go in the `R` directory
 - Tests go in the `tests` directory

## Package Management

 - The current package manager is more limited than pip/conda
 - Packrat will break if itself or R gets upgraded
 - Packrat doesn't handle external dependancies
 
## Docker
 
```
FROM rocker/tidyverse:latest

RUN R -e "install.packages(c('devtools'), repos = 'http://cran.us.r-project.org')"

ADD ./package /home/rstudio/package

WORKDIR /home/rstudio/package

RUN R -e 'devtools::install_deps(dependencies = TRUE, upgrade = "always")'

RUN R -e 'devtools::install()'

CMD ["Rscript", "~/package/exec/main.R"]
```
 
## Interopterability

 - The packages that allow communication between R and Python are not ready for prime-time

## Solution

 - Use PlumbR
